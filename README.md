# AI in Sports - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for AI applications in sports, developed by **Mike Niner Bravog**. The PoC demonstrates:

1. **Athlete Performance Analysis:** Using *data-driven metrics* to rank top-performing athletes.
2. **Injury Prediction:** Applying *Random Forest Classifier* to predict injury risks based on training intensity and fatigue.
3. **Sports Chatbot:** A simple chatbot that answers basic questions about AI in sports (expandable into a fully autonomous assistant).

## Installation
To run this PoC locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
Execute the Python script to see athlete performance ranking, injury risk predictions, and chatbot responses:

```bash
python ai_sports_poc.py
```

## Google Colab
The code is also available as a **Google Colab Notebook** for easy execution without local setup:
